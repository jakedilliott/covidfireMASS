## Covid Fire Multi Agent Seasona Simulation

An Agent-Based Model that simulates COVID dynamics within wildfire firefighter camps. This model assumes a hub-and-spoke camp model, which implements module based infection dynamics and quarantine protocols. This work is an extension of the Susceptible Infected Recovered(SIR) model, adding Exposed, Asymptomatic, and Quarantined agent health states. Hence the SEIRAQ model.
